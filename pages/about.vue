    <h1>More about Mads</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised mostly in Dallas, Texas. I
      moved to the UK when I was 17 and I've lived here ever since. I've got a
      chill husband and two very cool kids named Jack and Ben!

      I first got into programming by doing the CS50 courses and then was in the
      privileged position to be able to spend the next year of my life
      dedicating my full attention to teaching myself how to code. My first love
      is Javascript but I've been writing Python for the last few years and it's
      stolen my heart. I'm fullstack but have the most fun in the frontend!
